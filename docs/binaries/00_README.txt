Binary BorgBackup builds
========================

General notes
-------------

The binaries are supposed to work on the specified platform without installing anything else.

There are some limitations, though:
- for Linux, your system must have the same or newer glibc version as the one used for building
- for macOS, you need to have the same or newer macOS version as the one used for building
- for other OSes, there are likely similar limitations

If you don't find something working on your system, check the older borg releases.

*.asc are GnuPG signatures - only provided for locally built binaries.
*.exe (or no extension) is the single-file fat binary.
*.tgz is the single-directory fat binary (extract it once with tar -xzf).

Using the single-directory build is faster and does not require as much space
in the temporary directory as the self-extracting single-file build.

macOS: to avoid issues, download the file via the command line OR remove the
       "quarantine" attribute after downloading:
       $ xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine borg-macos1012.tgz

Note: if you don't find a specific binary here, check release 1.4.1 or 1.2.9.


Verifying your download
-----------------------

I provide GPG signatures for files which I have built locally on my machines.

To check the GPG signature, download both the file and the corresponding
signature (*.asc file) and then (on the shell) type, for example:

    gpg --recv-keys 9F88FB52FAF7B393
    gpg --verify borgbackup.tar.gz.asc borgbackup.tar.gz

The files are signed by:

Thomas Waldmann <tw@waldmann-edv.de>
GPG key fingerprint: 6D5B EF9A DD20 7580 5747 B70F 9F88 FB52 FAF7 B393

My fingerprint is also in the footer of all my BorgBackup mailing list posts.


Installing
----------

It is suggested that you rename or symlink the binary to just "borg".
If you need "borgfs", just also symlink it to the same binary, it will
detect internally under which name it was invoked.

On UNIX-like platforms, /usr/local/bin/ or ~/bin/ is a nice place for it,
but you can invoke it from anywhere by providing the full path to it.

Make sure the file is readable and executable (chmod +rx borg on UNIX-like
platforms).


Reporting issues
----------------

Please first check the FAQ and whether a GitHub issue already exists.

If you find a NEW issue, please open a ticket on our issue tracker:

https://github.com/borgbackup/borg/issues/

There, please give:
- the version number (it is displayed if you invoke borg -V)
- the sha256sum of the binary
- a good description of what the issue is
- a good description of how to reproduce your issue
- a traceback with system info (if you have one)
- your precise platform (CPU, 32/64-bit?), OS, distribution, release
- your Python and (g)libc versions
