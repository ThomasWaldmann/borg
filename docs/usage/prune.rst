Be careful: prune is a potentially dangerous command; it will remove backup
archives.

By default, prune applies to **all archives in the repository** unless you
restrict its operation to a subset of the archives using ``--glob-archives``.
When using ``--glob-archives``, be careful to choose a good matching pattern â€”
for example, do not use "foo*" if you do not also want to match "foobar".

It is strongly recommended to always run ``prune -v --list --dry-run ...``
first, so you can see what it would do without actually doing anything.

::

    # Keep 7 end-of-day and 4 additional end-of-week archives.
    # Do a dry-run without actually deleting anything.
    $ borg prune -v --list --dry-run --keep-daily=7 --keep-weekly=4 /path/to/repo

    # Same as above but only apply to archive names starting with the hostname
    # of the machine followed by a "-" character:
    $ borg prune -v --list --keep-daily=7 --keep-weekly=4 --glob-archives='{hostname}-*' /path/to/repo
    # Actually free disk space:
    $ borg compact /path/to/repo

    # Keep 7 end-of-day, 4 additional end-of-week archives,
    # and an end-of-month archive for every month:
    $ borg prune -v --list --keep-daily=7 --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=-1 /path/to/repo

    # Keep all backups in the last 10 days, 4 additional end-of-week archives,
    # and an end-of-month archive for every month:
    $ borg prune -v --list --keep-within=10d --keep-weekly=4 --keep-monthly=-1 /path/to/repo

There is also a visual example of pruning in ``docs/misc/prune-example.txt``:
